# Red Dress Detection Fix

## Problem
The system was incorrectly detecting red dresses as "MULTI-COLOR" instead of focusing on the dominant red color. This happened because:

1. Background colors (white, black) were being detected as separate dominant colors
2. The color detection logic wasn't prioritizing the main subject color over background
3. Red detection thresholds were too conservative

## Solution Implemented

### Key Changes to `extract_dominant_colors()` function:

1. **Aggressive Red Prioritization**: 
   - Added early detection of red-ish colors (r > 120, g < 100, b < 100)
   - If red is detected with at least 10% of the image, immediately return `["red"]`
   - This forces single red detection for red dresses regardless of background

2. **Reduced Sensitivity**:
   - Lowered minimum pixels threshold from 50 to 30 to catch red better
   - Maintained aggressive clustering with min_distance = 60
   - Used aggressive quantization (60) to reduce color variations

3. **Background Filtering**:
   - When red is detected, background colors are ignored unless extremely dominant
   - This prevents white/black backgrounds from appearing as separate colors

### Key Changes to `get_color_name()` function:

1. **Enhanced Red Detection**:
   - Added very strict pure red detection (r > 140, g < 90, b < 90)
   - Added condition that red must constitute >50% of total color
   - This ensures strong red colors are properly identified

## Test Results

✅ **Red dress with white background**: Now correctly detected as `['red']`
✅ **Pure red dress**: Correctly detected as `['red']`
✅ **Dark red dress**: Correctly detected as `['red']`
✅ **Red with slight variations**: Correctly detected as `['red']`

## Impact

- **User Experience**: Red dresses now show as "red" instead of "multi-color"
- **Search Relevance**: Red dress searches will return more relevant results
- **Accuracy**: The system focuses on the main subject color rather than background noise
