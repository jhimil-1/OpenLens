# Color Detection Improvements Summary

## Problem
The system was incorrectly detecting multiple colors (white, red, orange) for a pure red dress image, which reduced the effectiveness of color filtering in search results.

## Root Cause
The `extract_dominant_colors` function was too sensitive and would detect minor color variations as separate dominant colors, while the `get_color_name` function wasn't specific enough for pure red detection.

## Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced `extract_dominant_colors` function
- Reduced image resize dimensions from (150, 150) to (100, 100)
- Decreased number of sampled pixels from 5000 to 3000
- Increased quantization aggressiveness from 8 to 16
- Introduced stricter distance thresholds (min_distance: 60 â†’ 80)
- Increased minimum pixel count (min_pixels: 100 â†’ 150)
- Added confidence threshold (0.6) for color inclusion
- Focus on most dominant color when multiple colors are detected

### 2. Improved `get_color_name` function
- Added specific pure red detection: `if r > 150 and g < 80 and b < 80`
- Maintained existing ratio-based detection for other colors
- Improved accuracy for red variations while avoiding false positives

### 3. Updated Color Filtering Logic
- Increased penalty threshold from 0.80 to 0.85
- Enhanced focus on most dominant color when filtering
- Maintained color variation matching with `get_color_variations()`

## Test Results

### Before Improvements
- Pure red dress detected as: `['white', 'red', 'orange']`
- Multiple false color detections
- Ineffective color filtering

### After Improvements
- Pure red dress detected as: `['red']`
- Dark red dress detected as: `['red']`
- Varied red dress detected as: `['red']`
- Accurate color name detection for all test cases

## Impact
- Search results will now be filtered more accurately based on the dominant color
- Red dress searches will primarily return red-colored items
- Reduced false positives from minor color variations
- Improved overall search relevance and user experience

## Files Modified
- `main.py`: Updated `extract_dominant_colors()` and `get_color_name()` functions
- Enhanced color filtering logic in `search_similar_products()`

## Test Files Created
- `test_red_dress.py`: Comprehensive red color detection testing
- `test_final_red_detection.py`: Final verification of improvements
